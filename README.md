## Description

Simon Game presents players with a grid of colorful buttons, each associated with a distinct sound. The game begins with a simple sequence of button presses, which players must mimic. As players successfully replicate the sequence, the game gradually increases in difficulty by adding more buttons to the sequence.

The core challenge of Simon Game lies in remembering the growing sequence of button presses and reproducing them accurately. With each level, the sequences become longer and more intricate, testing the limits of players' memory and concentration.

The game provides immediate feedback through visual and auditory cues. Each button press triggers a corresponding sound effect and visual animation, enhancing player engagement and immersion. However, a single mistake in replicating the sequence leads to the end of the game, challenging players to continually improve their memory and beat their previous high score.

Simon Game is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. Whether played on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, players can enjoy a seamless gaming experience.
